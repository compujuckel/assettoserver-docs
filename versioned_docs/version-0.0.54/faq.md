## How do I get dense traffic? {#dense-traffic}

- Add more cars to the `entry_list.ini` that are used as traffic. This is the most important setting. It is pretty much impossible to achieve high traffic density with just 10 traffic cars, for example.
- Decrease `MinAiSafetyDistanceMeters` / `MaxAiSafetyDistanceMeters` to make gaps between AI cars smaller
  **Don't set it lower than ~12m or you might experience AI cars braking immediately after spawning!**
- Depending on how many people are on your server you could increase `AiPerPlayerTargetCount` / `MaxAiTargetCount`

## Why can't I drive certain cars on my server? {#locked-cars}

Certain car mods are designed to only be driven on servers that are whitelisted by the creators of the car mod.  
Affected cars usually do not respond to the gas pedal input if they are used on other servers.  
This restriction is built into the car mod itself and cannot be deactivated by any means.  
Please note that these restrictions are not a feature of AssettoServer.

## Why am I spawning in a different location than expected? {#spawn-locations}

Where you spawn depends on where the pit for each index is located for track and layout that you chose.  
For example, the Overload Layout of Shutoko Revival Project combines all 170 pits into a single layout.  
Because of that, it is possible to spawn in different locations depending on the index that each car has in the `entry_list.ini`.  
Here is a short list of which indices correspond to which spawn location for the Shutoko Revival Project - Overload Layout:

| Car Indices                | Spawn Location            |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `[CAR_0]`   to `[CAR_39]`  | Tatsumi PA                |
| `[CAR_40]`  to `[CAR_67]`  | Shibaura PA               |
| `[CAR_68]`  to `[CAR_86]`  | Yoyogi PA                 |
| `[CAR_87]`  to `[CAR_139]` | Heiwajima PA - Northbound |
| `[CAR_140]` to `[CAR_155]` | Heiwajima PA - Southbound |
| `[CAR_156]` to `[CAR_169]` | Daishi PA                 |

:::caution

It is not possible to skip or have duplicate indices in `entry_list.ini`.  
This means that you cannot start your entry list with `[CAR_87]` to have all cars spawn in Heiwajima, or have multiple `[CAR_0]` entries to have more than 40 cars spawn in Tatsumi.

## How do I remove checksums? {#remove-checksums}

:::caution

Only remove checksums if you're okay with users cheating.  
Checksums are required to prevent people from cheating by modifying their car and track data.  
Remove them at your own risk.

:::

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="cars" label="Car Checksums" default>

  - Navigate to the `\content\cars` folder on your server.
  - Remove the `data.acd` in the folder of every car that you want to use without checksums.
  - Enable MissingCarChecksums in `extra_cfg.yml` and restart the server.
  - If you've done everything correctly you should no longer see a `Added checksum for car_name` log message for the car you removed. If you've removed the checksum of all cars it should also log `Initialized 0 car checksums`.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="tracks" label="Track Checksums">

  - Navigate to the `\content\tracks\<track>\<layout>\data` (or `\content\tracks\csp\<track>\<layout>\data` if you're requiring a CSP version.) and `\system` folders on your server.
  - Remove both of the `surfaces.ini` files and restart the server.
  - If you've done everything correctly you should see the log message saying `Initialized 0 track checksums`

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

If you added any other checksums like track kn5's or car colliders, also remove those files.

## How do I add missing track params? {#adding-trackparams}

You can either add the parameters locally or ignore this error by setting `MissingTrackParams` to `true` in `extra_cfg.yml`.  
Keep in mind that setting `MissingTrackParams` to `true` can result in time not being synchronized between players and the server.  

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="new" label="Create New" default>

Navigate to the `cfg` folder of the server and open the `data_track_params.ini`.  
Go to the bottom of the file and add a section for your track using the folder name of your track as the header like this:
```ini title="data_track_params.ini"
[shuto_revival_project_beta_ptb]
NAME=SRP PTB
LATITUDE=
LONGITUDE=
TIMEZONE=
```

Open [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/) and find the location of the track.  
Right click onto the map and click the Longitute and Latitute values that will be shown as the first option to copy them.  
![](./assets/SrjDw4f.png)  
Paste them after the `LATITUDE=` and `LONGITUDE=` keys.

Open a [TZ timezone list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) and look for the time zone that the track is in, then copy the `TZ Identifier`.
![](./assets/LfFsktI.png)  
Paste it after the `TIMEZONE=` key.

You should now have something along the lines of this:
```ini title="data_track_params.ini"
[shuto_revival_project_beta_ptb]
NAME=SRP PTB
LATITUDE=35.67040
LONGITUDE=139.74085
TIMEZONE=Asia/Tokyo
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="reuse" label="Reuse Existing" default>

Navigate to the `cfg` folder of the server and open the `data_track_params.ini`.  
Find and copy the entry for the track you want to reuse.  
Change the header of the copied section to the folder name your current track.  
```ini title="data_track_params.ini"
; Original
[shuto_revival_project_beta]
NAME=SRP
LATITUDE=35.670479
LONGITUDE=139.740921
TIMEZONE=Asia/Tokyo
; Copied
[shuto_revival_project_beta_ptb]
NAME=SRP PTB
LATITUDE=35.670479
LONGITUDE=139.740921
TIMEZONE=Asia/Tokyo
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Save and close the file, open `extra_cfg.yml` and set `ForceServerParams` to `true`.  
Please also adjust the CSP version you're requiring if needed.

```yaml title="extra_cfg.yml"
# Force clients to use track params (coordinates, time zone) specified on the server. CSP 0.1.79+ required
ForceServerTrackParams: true
```

## How do I use CSP extra server options? {#csp-extra-options}

#### Requiring a minimum CSP Version {#requiring-csp-version}
<Tabs groupId="content-manager">
<TabItem value="content-manager" label="With Content Manager (Full Version)" default>

  In the `Main` tab, enable `Require CSP to Join` and enter the desired CSP version ID or click on `Autofill` to insert the version ID of the CSP version you have currently installed:  
  
  ![](./assets/HxAVvsd.png)

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="manual" label="Without Content Manager">

  - In `content/tracks` of your server, create a new folder called `csp`
  - Move your track folder into `content/tracks/csp`
  - In `server_cfg.ini` change the path of your track like this: `TRACK=csp/<CSPversionID>/../<trackname>`  
    For example: `TRACK=csp/2053/../shuto_revival_project_beta`
  - In `data/surfaces.ini` of your track, change `SURFACE_0` to `CSPFACE_0`

    :::caution ONLY CHANGE THE FIRST SURFACE IN THE FILE

      Changing more than `SURFACE_0` will result in checksum errors for clients!

    :::

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

<details>
<summary>**Where can I find CSP version IDs?**</summary>
<p>

In Content Manager, navigate to `Settings > Custom Shaders Patch > About & Updates` and look for the Currently active Shaders Patch version ID.

![](./assets/lKOfMSR.png)

If you need the ID of a version you currently don't have installed **[the official CSP Website](https://acstuff.ru/patch/)** lists the IDs in the `Other Versions` sections.

![](./assets/Upd4ZJl.png)

</p>
</details>

#### Adding CSP extra server options to the server {#extra-options-ini}
Navigate to the `cfg` folder of the server and create a file called `csp_extra_options.ini`.  
If you are hosting via Content Manager, click the `Folder` button at the bottom of the preset and create the file there instead.  

[This CSP wiki page](https://github.com/ac-custom-shaders-patch/acc-extension-config/wiki/Misc-%E2%80%93-Server-extra-options) has a long list of options you can use.  
The options on that page go into the `csp_extra_options.ini`, for example:

![](./assets/oxp4a21.png)    

### How do I allow driving the wrong way? {#wrong-way}

This is also used to remove the incorrectly displayed wrong way indicator on tracks like Shutoko Revival Project.  
If you want to make sure that people drive the correct way after adding this setting, use the [AutoModerationPlugin.](./plugins/AutoModerationPlugin.md)

```ini title="csp_extra_options.ini"
[EXTRA_RULES]
ALLOW_WRONG_WAY = 1   ; Allow cars to drive either way, gets rid of the wrong way sign on some tracks
```  
If you get teleported back to pits, you may need to remove the `fast_lane.ai` for the track in your local game files.  
By default: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\assettocorsa\content\tracks\<trackname>`.  

### How do I enable Teleportation? {#teleportation}

For teleporting, two things have to be done:

- Allowing cars in the entry list to teleport
- Adding teleport destinations to the `csp_extra_options.ini`

Depending on if you have the full version of Content Manager or not, there are two different ways to accomplish this:

<Tabs groupId="content-manager">
<TabItem value="content-manager" label="With Content Manager (Full Version)" default>

  Check `Allow teleporting` for each car on your entry list:  
  ![](./assets/Il4RrjG.png)

  Click on the `Folder` button at the bottom of your server, open `csp_extra_options.ini` and add your teleport destinations to it.  
  ![](./assets/h9c5e6K.png)

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="manual" label="Without Content Manager">

  - In your `entry_list.ini` add a option to the end of each skin, for example `SKIN=<skinname>/ADAn`

  | Code    | Option                                  |
  | ------- | --------------------------------------- |
  | `/ACA3` | Allow Teleporting                       |
  | `/ABAH` | Allow Color Changing                    |
  | `/ADAn` | Allow both Color Changing & Teleporting |

  This is **NOT** a full list of all codes and options available, just some of the most frequently used ones.  
  [Here is how it’s generated by Content Manager.](https://github.com/gro-ove/actools/blob/master/AcManager.Tools/Objects/ServerDriverCspOptions.cs#L123)

  - In the `cfg` folder of your server, open `csp_extra_options.ini` and add your teleport destinations to it.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>  

If done correctly you should now have a `Teleport to...` option in the chat apps extras:  
![](./assets/kdSQlWZ.png)

#### Where can I find teleport locations for SRP? {#srp-teleports}

Either use the teleports used on the official SRP servers below or make some yourself.

#### How do I make my own teleport locations? {#making-teleports}

You can use the Objects Inspector or the [comfy map app](https://www.racedepartment.com/downloads/comfy-map.52623/) to determine the coordinates and heading.  
The formating is as follows:

```ini
POINT_0 = Name               ; Destination name
POINT_0_GROUP = Group Name   ; Optional group
POINT_0_POS = X, Y, Z        ; Coordinates
POINT_0_HEADING = 0          ; Heading angle in degrees
```

:::note

The comfy map app is not required to create points, enable or use teleportation!

:::

### How do I enable Color Changing? {#color-changing}

```ini title="csp_extra_options.ini"
[CUSTOM_COLOR]
ALLOW_EVERYWHERE = 1   ; Change car colors anywhere as long as the car is stopped.
```

If AI cars are allowed to change their colors, they will spawn in random colors if possible. 

:::caution

Every car still needs to be allowed to change colors via the `entry_list.ini`.

:::

### How do I increase the speed in the pits? {#pit-speed-limiter}

```ini title="csp_extra_options.ini"
[PITS_SPEED_LIMITER]
KEEP_COLLISIONS = 0   ; Activate collisions between cars in pits
SPEED_KMH = 80        ; Alter pits speed limiter value; default is 80
```

### How do I use Server Scripts? {#csp-server-scripts}

:::note

Keep in mind that server scripts are different from AssettoServer Plugins, and we don’t provide support for them on our Discord.

:::

You're going to need to host your script in plaintext somewhere publicly accessible, for example:
  - Github / Pastebin
  - Your own media server (like IIS or others)
  - **DO NOT HOST ON DISCORD**

```ini title="csp_extra_options.ini"
[SCRIPT_...]
SCRIPT = "https://pastebin.com/raw/00000000000"    ; Change this to the url of your script
```

[There are more options available here.](https://github.com/CheesyManiac/cheesy-lua/wiki/Extra-CSP-Server-Config-Values#server-scripts)

## How do I allow players to download missing content? {#download-missing-content}

It's possible to allow players to download missing content like tracks and cars in the Content Manager server browser.

![](./assets/HfLjm64.png)

:::caution

Please use the download links the authors of the content you're using provide unless you're explicitly allowed to reupload them for yourself.

:::

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="content-manager" label="With Content Manager (Full Version)" default>

  - Navigate to the `Details` Tab in your Server preset.
  - In the `Share Mode` tab select "Download URL" and paste the direct download link into the `Download from` field.
  - Leave `Version Required` as it is since CM will autofill these for you, then save the preset.
  - A `content.json` file will be created in the `cm_content` folder under the directory of the server. Currently, this file does not get included when using the Pack feature.

  ![](./assets/TN1XGgZ.png)

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="manual" label="Without Content Manager">

  - Navigate to the `cfg` folder of your server.
  - Create a `cm_content` folder and in that folder a file named `content.json`.
  - In `content.json` you can now configure download links like so:

## How can I enable a Custom Steam API Replacement? {#custom-steam-api}
**AssettoServer does not support piracy and as such there is no way around buying Assetto Corsa and the DLC's required by the content you want to use.**  
If you used a pirated version of Assetto Corsa in the past and have since purchased everything, make sure to:  
- Verify your game files via Steam
- Change the Assetto Corsa game folder in the Content Manager general settings to your Steam installation.  
By default: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\assettocorsa\`

## How can I format my server description? {#server-description}

**Linebreaks**  
The `|-` modifier is probably the most important part to properly format your description.  
Read this site for more information: https://yaml-multiline.info/

**BBcode**  
The description in Content Manager uses BBcode tags, read: https://www.bbcode.org/reference.php  
To add images use `[img=<link>]img1[/img]`  
Keep in mind that some functions of BBcode are not supported by Content Manager.

**Example Description, do not add this to the bottom of the `extra_cfg.yml`.**
```yaml title="extra_cfg.yml"
# Server description shown in Content Manager. EnableServerDetails must be on
ServerDescription: |-
  [img=https://assettoserver.org/img/as-logo-cm.png]AssettoServer Logo[/img]
