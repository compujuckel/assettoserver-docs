## How do I get dense traffic? {#dense-traffic}

- Use more traffic slots. This is the most important setting. It is pretty much impossible to achieve high traffic density with just 10 traffic cars, for example.
- Decrease `MinAiSafetyDistanceMeters` / `MaxAiSafetyDistanceMeters` to make gaps between AI cars smaller.  
  **Don't set it lower than ~12m or you might experience AI cars braking immediately after spawning!**
- Decrease `MinSpawnDistancePoints` / `MaxSpawnDistancePoints` to spawn cars closer to the player and fill up gaps in traffic.

## How do I remove checksums? {#remove-checksums}

:::caution ONLY REMOVE CHECKSUMS IF YOU'RE OKAY WITH USERS CHEATING
Checksums are required to prevent people from cheating by modifying their car and track data. Remove them at your own risk.
:::

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="cars" label="Car Checksums" default>

  - Navigate to the `\content\cars` folder on your server.
  - Remove the `data.acd` in the folder of every car that you want to use without checksums.
  - Enable MissingCarChecksums in `extra_cfg.yml` and restart the server.
  - If you've done everything correctly you should no longer see a `Added checksum for car_name` log message for the car you removed. If you've removed the checksum of all cars it should also log `Initialized 0 car checksums`.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="tracks" label="Track Checksums">

  - Navigate to the `\content\tracks\<track>\<layout>\data` and `\system` folders on your server.
  - Remove both of the `surfaces.ini` files and restart the server.
  - If you've done everything correctly you should see the log message saying `Initialized 0 track checksums`

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## How do I add missing track params? {#adding-trackparams}

You can either add the parameters locally or ignore this error by setting `MissingTrackParams` to `true` in `extra_cfg.yml`.  
Keep in mind that setting `MissingTrackParams` to `true` can result in time not being synchronized between players and the server.  

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="new" label="Create New" default>

Navigate to the `cfg` folder of the server and open the `data_track_params.ini`.  
Go to the bottom of the file and add a section for your track using the folder name of your track as the header like this:
```ini title="data_track_params.ini"
[shuto_revival_project_beta_ptb]
NAME=SRP PTB
LATITUDE=
LONGITUDE=
TIMEZONE=
```

Open [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/) and find the location of the track.  
Right click onto the map and click the Longitute and Latitute values that will be shown as the first option to copy them.  
![](./assets/SrjDw4f.png)  
Paste them after the `LATITUDE=` and `LONGITUDE=` keys.

Open a [TZ timezone list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) and look for the time zone that the track is in, then copy the `TZ Identifier`.
![](./assets/LfFsktI.png)  
Paste it after the `TIMEZONE=` key.

You should now have something along the lines of this:
```ini title="data_track_params.ini"
[shuto_revival_project_beta_ptb]
NAME=SRP PTB
LATITUDE=35.67040
LONGITUDE=139.74085
TIMEZONE=Asia/Tokyo
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="reuse" label="Reuse Existing" default>

Navigate to the `cfg` folder of the server and open the `data_track_params.ini`.  
Find and copy the entry for the track you want to reuse.  
Change the header of the copied section to the folder name your current track.  
```ini title="data_track_params.ini"
; Original
[shuto_revival_project_beta]
NAME=SRP
LATITUDE=35.670479
LONGITUDE=139.740921
TIMEZONE=Asia/Tokyo
; Copied
[shuto_revival_project_beta_ptb]
NAME=SRP PTB
LATITUDE=35.670479
LONGITUDE=139.740921
TIMEZONE=Asia/Tokyo
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Save and close the file, open `extra_cfg.yml` and set `ForceServerParams` to `true`.  
Please also adjust `MinimumCSPVersion` if needed.
```yaml title="extra_cfg.yml"
# Override minimum CSP version required to join this server. Leave this empty to not require CSP.
MinimumCSPVersion: 2144

# Force clients to use track params (coordinates, time zone) specified on the server. CSP 0.1.79+ required
ForceServerTrackParams: true
```

## How do I use CSP extra server options? {#csp-extra-options}

Read [this CSP wiki page](https://github.com/ac-custom-shaders-patch/acc-extension-config/wiki/Misc-%E2%80%93-Server-extra-options) carefully. Everything you want to add goes into `cfg/csp_extra_options.ini`.  
If the file doesn't exist yet, create it yourself. For example:

![](./assets/oxp4a21.png)    
Place the file in the `cfg` folder of your server.  

:::note

If you're hosting the server via Content Manager, click the `Folder` button at the bottom of the preset and place it there instead.

:::

### How do I allow driving the wrong way? {#wrong-way}

```ini
[EXTRA_RULES]
ALLOW_WRONG_WAY = 1 
```  
If you get teleported back to pits, you may need to remove the `fast_lane.ai` for the track in your local game files.  
By default: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\assettocorsa\content\tracks\<trackname>`.  

### How do I enable Teleportation? {#teleportation}

For teleporting, two things have to be done:

- Allowing cars in the entry list to teleport
- Adding teleport destinations to the `csp_extra_options.ini`

Depending on if you have the full version of Content Manager or not, there are two different ways to accomplish this:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="content-manager" label="With Content Manager (Full Version)" default>

  Check `Allow teleporting` for each car on your entry list:  
  ![](./assets/Il4RrjG.png)

  Click on the `Folder` button at the bottom of your server, open `csp_extra_options.ini` and add your teleport destinations to it.  
  ![](./assets/h9c5e6K.png)

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="manual" label="Without Content Manager">

  - In your `entry_list.ini` add a option to the end of each skin, for example `SKIN=<skinname>/ADAn`

  | Code    | Option                                  |
  | ------- | --------------------------------------- |
  | `/ACA3` | Allow Teleporting                       |
  | `/ABAH` | Allow Color Changing                    |
  | `/ADAn` | Allow both Color Changing & Teleporting |

  This is **NOT** a full list of all codes and options available, just some of the most frequently used ones.  
  [Here is how itâ€™s generated by Content Manager.](https://github.com/gro-ove/actools/blob/master/AcManager.Tools/Objects/ServerDriverCspOptions.cs#L123)

  - In the `cfg` folder of your server, open `csp_extra_options.ini` and add your teleport destinations to it.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>  

If done correctly you should now have a `Teleport to...` option in the chat apps extras:

#### How do I make my own teleport locations? {#making-teleports}

You can use the Objects Inspector or the [comfy map app](https://www.racedepartment.com/downloads/comfy-map.52623/) to determine the coordinates and heading.  
The formating is as follows:

```ini
POINT_0 = Name               ; destination name
POINT_0_GROUP = Group Name   ; optional group
POINT_0_POS = X, Y, Z        ; coordinates
POINT_0_HEADING = 0          ; heading angle in degrees
```

**Having the comfy map app is not necessary to create points, enable or use teleportation!**

### How do I enable Color Changing? {#color-changing}

```ini
[CUSTOM_COLOR]
ALLOW_EVERYWHERE = 1
```

If AI cars are allowed to change their colors, they will spawn in random colors if possible.  
**Keep in mind that you still need to allow cars to change colors via the `entry_list.ini` even if you're using `ALLOW_EVERYWHERE`.**

### How do I increase the speed in the pits? {#pit-speed-limiter}

```ini
[PITS_SPEED_LIMITER]
KEEP_COLLISIONS = 0    ; will either activate or deactivate collisions between cars in the pits.
SPEED_KMH = 80         ; the maximum speed allowed, the default is 80.
```

[There are more options available here.](https://github.com/ac-custom-shaders-patch/acc-extension-config/wiki/Misc-%E2%80%93-Server-extra-options#pit-speed-limiter-settings)

## How do I allow players to download missing content? {#download-missing-content}

It's possible to allow players to download missing content like tracks and cars in the Content Manager server browser.

![](./assets/HfLjm64.png)

:::caution

Please use the download links the authors of the content you're using provide unless you're explicitly allowed to reupload them for yourself.

:::

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="content-manager" label="With Content Manager (Full Version)" default>

  - Navigate to the `Details` Tab in your Server preset.
  - In the `Share Mode` tab select "Download URL" and paste the direct download link into the `Download from` field.
  - Leave `Version Required` as it is since CM will autofill these for you, then save the preset.
  - A `content.json` file will be created in the `cm_content` folder under the directory of the server. Currently, this file does not get included when using the Pack feature.

  ![](./assets/TN1XGgZ.png)

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="manual" label="Without Content Manager">

  - Navigate to the `cfg` folder of your server.
  - Create a `cm_content` folder and in that folder a file named `content.json`.
  - In `content.json` you can now configure download links like so:

  ```json
  {
    "cars": {
      "car_name_here": {
        "url": "download url here",
        "version": "version here"
      },
      "car_name_two": {
        "url": "download url here",
        "version": "version here"
      }
    },
    "track": {
      "url": "download url here",
      "version": "version here"
    }
  }
  ```

  - The `version` has to match the version shown in the `Author` field in the content tab of the car/track.
  ![](./assets/eKKVEND.png)

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## How can I enable a Custom Steam API Replacement? {#custom-steam-api}
**AssettoServer does not support piracy and as such there is no way around buying Assetto Corsa and the DLC's required by the content you want to use.**  
If you used a pirated version of Assetto Corsa in the past and have since purchased everything, make sure to:  
- Verify your game files via Steam
- Change the Assetto Corsa game folder in the Content Manager general settings to your Steam installation.  
By default: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\assettocorsa\`

## How can I format my server description? {#server-description}

**Linebreaks**  
The `|-` modifier is probably the most important part to properly format your description.  
Read this site for more information: https://yaml-multiline.info/

**BBcode**  
The description in Content Manager uses BBcode tags, read: https://www.bbcode.org/reference.php  
To add images use `[img=<link>]img1[/img]`  
Keep in mind that some functions of BBcode are not supported by Content Manager.

**Example Description**
```yaml title="extra_cfg.yml"
ServerDescription: |-

## Where can I find the CSP version IDs? {#csp-version-ids}

The easiest way to get the ID for the CSP Version you're using is opening Content Manager and navigating to `Settings > Custom Shaders Patch > About & Updates` and then reading the Currently active Shaders Patch version ID.

If you need the ID of a version you currently don't have installed [the official CSP Website](https://acstuff.ru/patch/) also has the IDs in the `Other Versions` sections.
